# EasyDCP

A python package for agricultural phenotype traits extraction from 2D image sets via 3D reconstruction and analysis of 3D point clouds.
This script handles multiple sets of images taken in the same environment, such as timescale photos of a plot or several groups of plants photographed in the same place.
EasyDCP consists of two components:

- EasyDCP_Creation

Key features:

- Measure plant height, long and short axis, projected leaf area, convex hull volume, and more
- Batch processing multiple image sets
